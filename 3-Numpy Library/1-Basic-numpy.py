# NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
# functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
# The array object in NumPy is called ndarray
# NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
# This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists.

import numpy as np

array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
print(array)
print("Version name of numpy : ", np.__version__)
